                  <h3>About Me</h3>
                  <p>Hi! I'm Peter, a 26 year old full stack Web developer.
                    I've always loved programming and have been doing it since I was 16.
                    I spend a large amount of my free time working on various software side projects of my own.</p>
                  </br>
                    <p>I am looking for a small company where my hardwork and innovative ideas can make a real impact and be rewarded as a result.
                    a company where I can grow, not just as a programmer, but as a business man and a leader.
                    My goal is to one day have acquired the skills, knowledge, responsibilities and experience to run a successful company. </p>

                  <p>I'm extremely passionate about two things: self improvement, and building great things so, I'm looking for a small company where I can do both. A company that I can really sink my teeth into, make a big impact, and grow along the way.</p>
                  </br>
                  <p>My goal is to one day have acquired the skills, knowledge, and experience to run a great company of my own, but, to run a great company, I believe I must first be a part of one. I would love the opportunity to discuss potential positions in your company and how I could be a great addition to your team.</p>
