                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>I'm a 24 year old, hardworking and innovative Web Developer looking for the next challenge in my career. After graduating at the top of my class from UOIT, I jumped head first into the world of web development, where I quickly grew my skills. Now After two years I am extremely happy with the progress I have made having become a key contributor to my team and my company. I provide great knowledge and value to any project I get my hands on.</p> </br> <p>Now as I continue my career growth, I am looking for a company that can offer a series of new challenges, and a place where both my technical and personal skills can continue to evolve so I can be the leader I want to become.</p>
